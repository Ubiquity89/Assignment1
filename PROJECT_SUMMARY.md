# Task Management Application - Interview Assignment Submission

## Project Overview
A full-stack task management web application demonstrating proficiency in modern web development technologies and best practices.

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with accessibility considerations
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with CSS variables, flexbox/grid, responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Clean, modular code with async/await, error handling
- **No Frameworks**: Pure vanilla JavaScript showcasing fundamental skills

### Backend Technologies
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment with Express.js framework
- **RESTful API**: Well-designed CRUD endpoints following REST principles
- **In-Memory Storage**: Efficient data management with fallback persistence
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup

### Key Features Implemented
- ✅ **CRUD Operations**: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with professional UI/UX
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Instant task management without page refreshes
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Client and server-side input validation
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with user feedback
- ✅ **Status Management**: Task filtering by status (Pending, In Progress, Completed)
- ✅ **Professional UI**: Clean, modern interface with consistent design patterns

### Code Quality Highlights
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with organized file structure
- **Error Handling**: Robust try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
- **Input Validation**: Character limits, required fields, sanitization
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support
- **Performance**: Optimized DOM manipulation, efficient data handling
- **Security**: XSS prevention, input sanitization, CORS configuration

### Technical Decisions
- **In-Memory Storage**: Chosen for simplicity and reliability in demo environment
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Demonstrates strong fundamental programming skills
- **RESTful Design**: Industry-standard API architecture
- **Responsive CSS**: Mobile-first design with modern CSS features
